# Ultra Race Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains data analysis and visualization code for exploring performance trends in ultra marathon events. It focuses on analyzing athlete demographics, race conditions, and speed metrics in 50km and 50mi races.

## Data Source

The dataset contains detailed information on ultra marathon races spanning over two centuries. It includes attributes such as race dates, race names, athlete performances, athlete demographics, and more.

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633).
